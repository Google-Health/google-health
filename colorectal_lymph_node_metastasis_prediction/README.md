# Lymph node metastasis prediction: machine-learned feature generation/selection and model evaluation

This repo contains the code needed to generate and select cluster-based
machine-learned features while controlling for baseline features as described
in "Predicting lymph node metastasis from primary tumor histology and clinicopathologic factors in colorectal cancer using deep learning." For an example of how this 
code may be used, see demo.ipynb.

but not limited to diagnosis or prognosis.
