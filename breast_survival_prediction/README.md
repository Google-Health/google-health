# Breast Cancer Survival Prediction: Stage-2 Featurization Code

This repo contain code to reproduce the stage2 featurization of all three
components of the automatic Nottingham grading system. This is described in the
paper "Deep learning models for histologic grading of breast cancer and
association with disease prognosis"
[[Link](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41523-022-00478-y)].
For an example of how the code should be used, please refer to example.ipynb.

NOTE: the content of this research code repository (i) is not intended to be a
medical device; and (ii) is not intended for clinical use of any kind, including
but not limited to diagnosis or prognosis.
